# COVID vaccination impact on CHD patients

## Project description

Congenital heart disease (CHD) patients were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic as a vulnerable group at increased risk of severe outcomes from Sars-CoV-2 infection. Up-to-date health data following widespread vaccination enables a reassessment of these risks in the vaccinated CHD population.



In this sub-project, we aimed to:

1.	Characterise the risks from COVID-19 to vaccinated CHD patients compared to vaccinated controls.
2.	Compare the reduction in vaccine efficacy over time between CHD cases and controls.
3.	Examine the additional risk experienced by vaccinated CHD patients with increased anatomical complexity and physiological severity.
4.	Compare the incidence of vaccine-associated complications between CHD cases and controls.
